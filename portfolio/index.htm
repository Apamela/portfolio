    <p>When I found out that my college made nightly static reports of every single course offered in a semester,
         I decided to make a personal project. I did the project that took my course choices,
          start time and end time for class on each day,
         , and returned every possible projectIn the end,
          I made program that let people buy many things at the same time as they wishes. </p>
